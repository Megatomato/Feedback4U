To create a personal budget for the person to ensure they can attend the Paralympics, I will investigate suitable government allowances available to them and then create a weekly budget using a spreadsheet program. The budget will be used to save for the trip. The total amount of money required will need to include: ‚Ä¢ airfares, including increases due to inÔ¨Çation (using the compound interest formula) ‚Ä¢ accommodation ‚Ä¢ travel insurance ‚Ä¢ spending money for entertainment and extra meals.

For this calculation, I will observe the conversion rate once a week for the next three weeks and use the mean. Note: The mathematical concepts I will use to investigate this problem are shown in bold type above. 2Initial Considerations ‚Äì Observations and Assumptions 1. The task states that the supporter is entitled to government disability support and has a part-time job. Looking at the available support online it would seem that the ‚ÄòDisability Support Pension‚Äô is the most appropriate'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 15.5 (Build 24F74) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': "D:20250630033108Z00'00'", 'moddate': "D:20250630033108Z00'00'", 'source': '../../ragdb/training-data/feedback-data/[TEST] PSMT.pdf', 'total_pages': 10, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='(Department of Human Services 2017a) with a base rate of $808.30 each fortnight. 2. The task also states that the supporter has a part-time job. I will assume that the supporter earns the maximum fortnightly amount that will not acect their Disability Support Pension. Therefore, they will earn $164 (Department of Human Services 2017b) each fortnight from a part-time job. 3. The cost of airfares can vary signiÔ¨Åcantly. Looking at various websites it seems that buying tickets well in advance and for non-direct Ô¨Çights are cheaper. Therefore, the tickets chosen for this investigation will be the cheapest available bought well in advance. 4. Exchange rates change daily, so it is important to look for the best rates. For this investigation I have used an exchange rate of 1 AUD = 86.8739 JPY found in Appendix 3 at www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=AUD&To=JPY 5. I have assumed that the person lives in Brisbane, already has a passport and is 21.  6'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 15.5 (Build 24F74) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': "D:20250630033108Z00'00'", 'moddate': "D:20250630033108Z00'00'", 'source': '../../ragdb/training-data/feedback-data/[TEST] PSMT.pdf', 'total_pages': 10, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='.  6. Travel insurance needs to be taken out for the trip. I will assume no major injury occurs outside stipulated health insurance conditions on the trip, as this could cause extra unexpected expenses. 7. The person plans to see four dicerent events, which will be held at a variety of venues in Tokyo. The maximum price is expected to be 6000 Yen per ticket, so I will assume that all 4 tickets are the maximum expected price. 8. For budgeting the regular expenses are estimates based on averaging information sourced from family and friends. 3Developing the budget 3.1 Income 3.1.1 Government allowances'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 15.5 (Build 24F74) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': "D:20250630033108Z00'00'", 'moddate': "D:20250630033108Z00'00'", 'source': '../../ragdb/training-data/feedback-data/[TEST] PSMT.pdf', 'total_pages': 10, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='The government allowance available for this person is a Disability Support Pension (Department of Human Services 2017a).

If they earn more than this amount, their pension will be reduced by 50 cents for each dollar over $164 (Department of Human Services 2017b). The person will work part-time at their local corner shop at a rate of $19.44/hour (Fair Work Ombudsman 2017). They want to work the maximum number of hours without acecting their pension.

I used a Ô¨Çight comparison website and found 383 Ô¨Çight options. The best return price was $924 with Thai Airways; however, Ô¨Çights were over 32 hours each way and arrived very late at night. The most expensive return Ô¨Çights were with British Airways at $9702, and did not leave either country on the correct days. Most Ô¨Çights had at least one stopover. I decided on a Singapore Airlines return Ô¨Çight because it is about 20 hours each way. The Ô¨Çights stop in Singapore and cost only $1060.95 in total. 3.2.2 Travel insurance Travel insurance of $116.13 covers overseas emergency assistance, medical and hospital coverage, cancellation and luggage protection. 3.2.3 Airfares, travel insurance and Paralympic tickets (see Appendix 1) Paralympic tickets Event ticket cost = 6 000 Yen √ó4 = 24 000 Yen = 24 000 √∑ 86'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 15.5 (Build 24F74) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': "D:20250630033108Z00'00'", 'moddate': "D:20250630033108Z00'00'", 'source': '../../ragdb/training-data/feedback-data/[TEST] PSMT.pdf', 'total_pages': 10, 'page': 4, 'page_label': '5'}, page_content='.8739 AUD  = $276.26 Total upfront expenses Airfares + travel insurance + event ticket cost = $1060.95 + $116.13 + $276.26  = $1453.34 Increase due to inÔ¨Çation These costs are likely to increase over the next three years due to inÔ¨Çation, so I will calculate the future increased cost.

There was one in a good location for $63/night, including home-cooked meals (see Appendix 6). As 2020 prices are not available at this point, I will budget for $200/day, which will allow for eating out as well as some home cooked meals at the homestay accommodation.

Using the budget in Section 4.2 to save for expenses helps plan for the trip. However, this is not the best solution as, according to the budget calculations, the spectator is living beyond their means and cannot acord to go to the Paralympic Games given these initial calculations and budget. 5.1 Strengths and limitations The strengths of the original model are that it covered income from available government allowances and a part-time job and a weekly budget to save for the trip was then developed.

The limitation of the original model, that the person cannot acord to go to the Paralympics, can be overcome with lifestyle changes that will help build further savings. 5.2 Further savings Changes in the new budget: Reduce spending on clothing and shoes by 50%.

The budget takes into consideration likely price increases due to inÔ¨Çation but also includes reduced spending on non-essential items. 6.1 Recommendations Further recommendations regarding the budget would be to include the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Some calculations have included increased costs due to inÔ¨Çation; however, a standard increase due to the CPI would more thoroughly cover predicted costs.')]
