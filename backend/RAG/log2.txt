The \nbudget will be used to save for the trip. The total amount of money required will \nneed to include: \n‚Ä¢ airfares, including increases due to inÔ¨Çation (using the compound \ninterest formula) \n‚Ä¢ accommodation \n‚Ä¢ travel insurance \n‚Ä¢ spending money for entertainment and extra meals. Once I have calculated the amount of money in Australian dollars, this amount \nwill need to be converted into Japanese yen. For this calculation, I will \nobserve the conversion rate once a week for the next three weeks and use the \nmean. Note: The mathematical concepts I will use to investigate this problem are \nshown in bold type above. 2Initial Considerations ‚Äì \nObservations and Assumptions \n1. The task states that the supporter is entitled to government disability \nsupport and has a part-time job. Looking at the available support online it \nwould seem that the ‚ÄòDisability Support Pension‚Äô is the most appropriate \n(Department of Human Services 2017a) with a base rate of $808.30 each \nfortnight. 2. The task also states that the supporter has a part-time job. I will assume \nthat the supporter earns the maximum fortnightly amount that will not acect \ntheir Disability Support Pension. Therefore, they will earn $164 \n(Department of Human Services 2017b) each fortnight from a part-time job.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='3. The cost of airfares can vary signiÔ¨Åcantly. Looking at various websites it \nseems that buying tickets well in advance and for non-direct Ô¨Çights are \ncheaper. Therefore, the tickets chosen for this investigation will be the \ncheapest available bought well in advance.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='4. Exchange rates change daily, so it is important to look for the best rates. For this investigation I have used an exchange rate of 1 AUD = 86.8739 \nJPY found in Appendix 3 at \nwww.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=AUD&To=JPY \n5.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='I have assumed that the person lives in Brisbane, already has a passport \nand is 21. 6. Travel insurance needs to be taken out for the trip. I will assume no major \ninjury occurs outside stipulated health insurance conditions on the trip, as \nthis could cause extra unexpected expenses. 7. The person plans to see four dicerent events, which will be held at a variety \nof venues in Tokyo. The maximum price is expected to be 6000 Yen per \nticket, so I will assume that all 4 tickets are the maximum expected price.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='8. For budgeting the regular expenses are estimates based on averaging \ninformation sourced from family and friends. 3Developing the budget \n3.1 Income \n3.1.1 Government allowances \nThe government allowance available for this person is a Disability Support \nPension (Department of Human Services 2017a). Government payments also \navailable for someone receiving a pension are the pension supplement, energy \nsupplement and rent assistance. $808.30 pension basic rate \n+ $65.90 pension supplement \n+ $14.10 energy supplement \n+ $130.60 rent assistance \n= $1018.90/fortnight \nTotal government allowances per fortnight: $1018.90 \n3.1.2 Part-time job \nThe person can earn up to $164 per fortnight without acecting their pension. If \nthey earn more than this amount, their pension will be reduced by 50 cents for \neach dollar over $164 (Department of Human Services 2017b). The person will work part-time at their local corner shop at a rate of $19.44/hour \n(Fair Work Ombudsman 2017). They want to work the maximum number of \nhours without acecting their pension. Maximum allowable hours \n$164 \n$19.44/hr = 8.4362 hours/fortnight \nTherefore, they will work eight hours (rounded down to nearest hour) per \nfortnight, or four hours per week. 3.1.3 Total income \n \nPart-time job income: 8 √ó$19.44 = $155.52/fortnight \nTotal fortnightly income: $1018.90 + $155.52 = $1174.42/fortnight \n3.2 Expenses \n3.2.1 Airfares \nFlights cannot be booked three years in advance, so I looked at fares for 24 \nAugust to 7 September 2017 and applied increases according to inÔ¨Çation to \nestimate the future costs. I used a Ô¨Çight comparison website and found 383 \nÔ¨Çight options. The best return price was $924 with Thai Airways; however, \nÔ¨Çights were over 32 hours each way and arrived very late at night. The most \nexpensive return Ô¨Çights were with British Airways at $9702, and did not leave \neither country on the correct days. Most Ô¨Çights had at least one stopover. I decided on a Singapore Airlines return Ô¨Çight because it is about 20 hours each \nway. The Ô¨Çights stop in Singapore and cost only $1060.95 in total. 3.2.2 Travel insurance \nTravel insurance of $116.13 covers overseas emergency assistance, medical \nand hospital coverage, cancellation and luggage protection. 3.2.3 Airfares, travel insurance and Paralympic tickets \n(see Appendix 1) \nParalympic tickets \nEvent ticket cost = 6 000 Yen √ó4 \n= 24 000 Yen \n= 24 000 √∑ 86.8739 AUD \n = $276.26 \nTotal upfront expenses \nAirfares + travel insurance + event ticket cost = $1060.95 + $116.13 + $276.26 \n = $1453.34 \nIncrease due to inÔ¨Çation \nThese costs are likely to increase over the next three years due to inÔ¨Çation, so I \nwill calculate the future increased cost.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='The Australian annual inÔ¨Çation rate \nÔ¨Çuctuates (Rate InÔ¨Çation 2017). I calculated the mean of the rate from 2012 to \n2016. 1.3 + 1.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 1.7 \n5 = 1.9 \nThe average inÔ¨Çation rate was 1.9% over the past Ô¨Åve years. Using the 2017 airfare, travel insurance and event ticket cost of $1453.34 and \napplying an increase in price of \n \nPredicted cost in 2020 \nùê¥ùê¥ = ùëÉùëÉ \x001 + \nùëñùëñ \n100\x00 \nùëõùëõ \nùê¥ùê¥ = 1453.34 √ó1.0193 = $1537.76 \nI rounded this amount to $1550, which I will use for my budget calculations. 3.2.4 Accommodation and food \nUsing the Homestay website, www.homestay.com, I found accommodation \nstarting at $20/night. There was one in a good location for $63/night, including \nhome-cooked meals (see Appendix 6). As 2020 prices are not available at this point, I will budget for $200/day, which \nwill allow for eating out as well as some home cooked meals at the homestay \naccommodation. Accommodation at Homestay and some eating out for 11 days (24 August. to \n7 September): \n14 √ó200 = 2800 \nTotal accommodation cost: $2800. 3.2.5 Extra spending money \nThe spectator will need to travel between their accommodation and the sporting \nvenues. They will also want to see the sights and attractions of Tokyo, so extra \nspending money of $100/day for 14 days will also be budgeted for. 14 √ó100 = 1400 \nTotal spending money required: $1400. 3.2.6 Foreign currency exchange \nSpending money of $1400 needs to be converted to Japanese yen. The \nexchange rate changes daily, so it would be best for the person to check the \nexchange rate regularly and exchange cash when the rate is favourable. Once the amount of spending money in Australian dollars has been calculated, \nthis will need to be converted into Japanese yen. I have used an online \ncalculator to estimate what the exchange rate will be (see Appendix 3). Exchanging Australian dollars for Japanese yen \n1400 √ó 86.8739 = 121 623.46 \nWhen they convert their $1400 into Yen, they will have ¬•121 623.46. 4Budget summary \nA budget needs to be prepared that includes: \n‚Ä¢ person‚Äôs regular income \n‚Ä¢ person‚Äôs regular expenses \n‚Ä¢ savings required for the Paralympics trip. 4.1 Regular income \nThe person‚Äôs regular income is $1174.42/fortnight from government allowances \nand their part-time job. See section 3.1. 4.2 Regular expenses \nThe person‚Äôs regular expenses include food, electricity, health insurance, rent, \nentertainment and necessities such as clothing and shoes. Estimated values \nare given in the spreadsheet below based on research online and comparing \nwith family and friends. See Appendix 5 for budget spreadsheet cal \n4.3 Savings needed for Paralympics \n$1550 (airfares, travel insurance and event tickets) \n+ $2800 (accommodation, including food, at the Olympic Village) \n+ $1400 (spending money ‚Äî to be converted to Japanese yen) \n= $5750 total money required for trip. 5Evaluating the budget \nCan the person acord to attend as a spectator at the Paralympic Games? Using \nthe budget in Section 4.2 to save for expenses helps plan for the trip. However, \nthis is not the best solution as, according to the budget calculations, the \nspectator is living beyond their means and cannot acord to go to the Paralympic \nGames given these initial calculations and budget. 5.1 Strengths and limitations \nThe strengths of the original model are that it covered income from available \ngovernment allowances and a part-time job and a weekly budget to save for the \ntrip was then developed. The total cost required included: \n‚Ä¢ the cost of airfares, including increases due to inÔ¨Çation \n‚Ä¢ accommodation \n‚Ä¢ travel insurance \n‚Ä¢ spending money for entertainment and extra meals. The limitation of the original model, that the person cannot acord to go to the \nParalympics, can be overcome with lifestyle changes that will help build further \nsavings. 5.2 Further savings \nChanges in the new budget: \nReduce spending on clothing and shoes by 50%. Reduce spending on the telephone bill by remaining on a $50/month phone \nplan instead of upgrading to the $60/month plan. Move out of the rented house and into a boarding house. The boarding house is \ncheaper and electricity is included. Rent savings: $350 ‚àí $120 = $230/wk. Electricity savings: $580/quarter. Sell the car and use public transport. Although public transport will be a new \ncost, it will only be $9.36/week (see Appendix 2). The savings in the Ô¨Årst year \nare listed below, and greater savings will be made in the following years due to \nincreased costs for these items. 1. No car payments, saving $120/week. 2. No petrol needed, saving $40/week. 3. No car servicing, saving $120 every 6 months. 4. No car insurance, saving $310 every 6 months. These calculations are included in the budget in Appendix 5. 5.3 Excess currency \nAt the end of the trip there may be some Japanese currency unspent. It is \nassumed that the amount remaining will be 10% of the amount originally \nbudgeted for. ¬•121 623.46 √ó10% = ¬•12 162.346 \nThe exchange rate has changed from the start of the trip to when they returned \nto Australia. See Appendix 4. 5.3.1 Converting remaining yen back to Australian \ndollars \n12 162.346 √ó0.011 = 133.79 \nRemaining Japanese yen converted back to Australian dollars would be \n$133.79. 5.4 Amount required to save for trip \nThe original budgeted amount required was $5750. With the new budget, outlined below, they will have saved $7052.71, prior to the \nTokyo games, which is more than they need. Therefore, they can now acord \nthe trip. See Appendix 5 for budget formula spreadsheet. 6Conclusion \nIn the original budget, the spectator could not acord to attend the Paralympics. By making some lifestyle changes they can now acord the trip. The new budget results in savings of $7052.71. The spectator needs $5750 to fund the trip. Therefore, they can now acord the \ntrip. The budget takes into consideration likely price increases due to inÔ¨Çation \nbut also includes reduced spending on non-essential items. 6.1 Recommendations \nFurther recommendations regarding the budget would be to include the \nConsumer Price Index (CPI). Some calculations have included increased costs \ndue to inÔ¨Çation; however, a standard increase due to the CPI would more \nthoroughly cover predicted costs. ')]
